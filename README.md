# 🏗️ Static Site Generator

Welcome to my **Static Site Generator** project!
In this repository, I’ve built a simple yet powerful tool that takes raw content files (like Markdown and images) and turns them into a fully static website — complete with HTML and CSS output.

## 🚀 What You’ll Find Here

This project doesn’t just build a site — it **builds the tool that builds the site**.
Think of it as a meta-project: instead of manually writing HTML for every page, you create content in Markdown, and this generator handles the rest!

You can also deploy your generated site to a live URL on the web. It’s lightweight, fast, and fun to work with.

## 💡 What Is a Static Site Generator?

A **static site generator (SSG)** takes raw content (e.g., Markdown, images, templates) and compiles it into a static website — a collection of plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

### Why Static Sites?

Static sites are incredibly:

* ⚡ **Fast** – Served directly from a CDN or file host, with no runtime processing.
* 🔒 **Secure** – No database or server-side code means fewer vulnerabilities.
* 💰 **Cheap to Host** – Can be hosted on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static host.

Popular examples of production-ready SSGs include **Hugo**, **Jekyll**, and **Next.js (Static Export)**.
This project takes inspiration from those tools — but is built completely from scratch.

| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Content changes                             | Only when you rebuild                  | Can change on the fly                  |
| Requires database                           | ❌ No                                   | ✅ Yes                                  |

| Hosting complexity                          | Simple                                 | More complex                           |
| Ideal for                                   | Blogs, portfolios, docs, landing pages | Web apps, dashboards, social platforms |
